| **CPU**           | AMD Ryzen 5 4600H (Zen 2, 6C/12T) |

üîß What Works & What Doesn't
‚úÖ Everything except WiFi & Bluetooth (because Realtek chips aren‚Äôt supported)
‚ùå No NVIDIA GPU acceleration (as expected)

For WiFi and Bluetooth, I‚Äôm considering getting a USB adapter or replacing the internal card with a Broadcom or Intel one.

Overall, macOS sequoia runs smoothly, and I‚Äôm happy with the performance! üöÄ If anyone else is attempting this on the same laptop, feel free to ask for help.
